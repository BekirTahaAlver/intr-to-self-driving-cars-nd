Udacity - Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree 

**Topics Covered**
1. Bayesian Thinking
2. Working with Matrices
3. C++ Basics
4. Performance Programming in C++
5. Navigating Data Structures
6. Vehicle Motion and Control
7. Computer Vision and Machine Learning

**1. Bayesian Thinking**

I learned the framework that underlies a self-driving carâ€™s understanding of itself and the world around it, and to see the world the way a self-driving car does.

**2. Working with Matrices**

In this course, I focused on two tools which are vital to self-driving car engineers: object oriented programming and linear algebra.

**3. C++ Basics**

This course is the first step in a rewarding journey towards C++ expertise. The goal is translation: get a program written in Python, and translate it into C++.

**4. Performance Programming in C++**

Explored how to write good code that runs correctly. I focused primarily on low level features of C++.

**5. Navigating Data Structures**

In this course I focused on frequently used data structures and algorithms.
